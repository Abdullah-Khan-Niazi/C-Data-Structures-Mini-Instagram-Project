# C++-Data-Structures-Mini-Instagram-Project

This project simulates a mini-version of Instagram using custom data structures without built-in libraries. It features user profiles with graph-based friendship management, queue-based friend requests, stack-based messaging and posts, and a BST for efficient user search. Notifications are managed through queues, and the modular design ensures scalability and robust error handling. Explore the code to see the implementation!
