# C++-Data-Structures-Mini-Instagram-Project

This project simulates a micro-version of Instagram using custom data structures without built-in libraries. It features:

-User Profiles: Includes name, password, city, posts, and active status with graph-based friendship management.
-Friend Requests: Managed via queues for FIFO processing, with admin controls for user updates.
-Messaging: Stack-based conversations for recent messages and real-time messaging using queues.
-Posts & Newsfeed: Stack-based posts for quick retrieval and personalized timelines.
-Search: Efficient user search using a Binary Search Tree (BST).
-Notifications: Queue-based system for managing and displaying updates.
-Modular Design: Functions and classes ensure scalability and error handling.
